Air Quality Companion - Project Statement
Problem Statement
Urban air pollution has become a critical global health concern, with millions exposed to hazardous air quality levels daily. Current air quality monitoring systems present significant challenges: they provide raw technical data (PM2.5, AQI numbers) without meaningful interpretation, offer generic recommendations that lack personalization, and fail to translate complex environmental metrics into actionable daily guidance. This creates a dangerous knowledge gap where citizens cannot make informed decisions about outdoor activities, health protections, or lifestyle adjustments despite having access to air quality information. The problem is particularly acute in rapidly developing regions where air quality fluctuates dramatically and public awareness remains limited.
